# Ludo - In Your Browser!

*inspired by the game [Ludo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludo_(board_game)), derived from Pachisi - originally developed in India circa 6th century C.E.*

## Game summary
 
 Ludo is a strategy board game for 2 - 4 players (here, we will have 2). Each player has 4 tokens and rolls two dice.
 
 1. Sequence of turns: Red - Yellow - Green - Blue
 2. All tokens stay in player bases. Players can add a piece to the board by rolling a 6 on one die face.
 3. If a player has multiple pieces on the board, they will get to choose which piece to move.

 **Win condition:** The first that gets all four tokens to home!

 **Features:** a button to roll the dice, a card with buttons for Rule 3, notifications at the bottom for each new move from every player.

    4. If player A's token lands on the space of player B's token, token B must return to the base :(
    5. Players can split their rolls by die face: if it is a 6 + 2, players can choose which piece moves 2, which moves 6 (or enters the board).

## App specs
- First refactored the whole thing to be a react app (copy/pasting HTML)

- Then followed the `boardgame.io` tutorial for a simple 2-player, local game.

- Finally, extracted HTML to JSX and reorganized component structure (involving a lot of not-so-great practices ðŸ˜¬) <= this is where most of my time went

### Planning:
- Feature / bug tracking through Github Projects / Issues
- CSS grid mockup using [Layoutit Grid](https://grid.layoutit.com/)

### Technologies used:
- SCSS: CSS Grid, Flexbox, animation, media query, mixins, variables
- React / Node: components, array methods, custom classes, callbacks, event listeners, esm node server
- [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/): component library that supplied the cards, buttons, alerts, and icons.
- [`notistack`](https://www.iamhosseindhv.com/notistack): library that pushes multiple snackbar notifications on top of each other
- [`boardgame.io`](https://boardgame.io/): API/framework that manages game state and integrates multiplayer functionality
- [Websocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API): API that allows for two-way communications between clients via a server.

## Lessons/Ongoing Issues
[] Notifications are showing the wrong player name

[] Showing the choice card shifts the board rightward

### Pride
- While this isn't how they *want* us to use it, I used the `bgio` framework's handling of possible moves to be almost a method for their game state
